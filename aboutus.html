        <h2>Our Inspiration </h2>
        <p>Back pain is a common problem among the adult population. Suffering from back pain can cause limitations to mobility, making everyday activities difficult to conduct. Inability to undertake these basic activities can be demoralising, as such advancements should be made to tackle the growing issue. </p>
        <p>One such advancement that can be made is the development of an automated desk unit that raises and lowers drawers for the user’s convenience – the inspiration for this endeavour. This project specifically focuses on accessibility of low shelves – developing an automated unit that reduces the need to reach down.</p>
        <p>The target market for the device is the elderly population – the sector of the population in which back pain is most prevalent. Research shows that 65-85% of older adults suffer from musculoskeletal pain, with up to 70% suffering from back pain. Therefore, developing a device to assist with reaching low level storage will immensely improve quality of life by improving independent function and minimising strain on the back.</p>
        <p>Additional consideration must be taken when designing towards the elderly. The interface must be intuitive to operate. The product must not leave the user susceptible to harm from uncovered mechanisms or protruding sharp edges. These key points, as well as others, were considered when forming a solution.</p>
