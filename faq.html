            <p> <b>BootStrap:</b>
              <br> The template for this website was found on <a href='https://startbootstrap.com/' > <b>Start Bootstrap</b></a>. The <a href='https://startbootstrap.com/previews/modern-business/'><b>‘Modern Business’</b></a> template was used. The template was utilised due to its appropriate configuration to employ cowboy coding principles for the required content of the website. For example, this section was well suited to the FAQ page and the Contact Us page had a validated form. Additionally, the template was free.
            </p> <b>GitHub Desktop:</b>
            <br> GitHub was used to host and publish the website. There are many benefits to using GitHub – its free, collaborative, implements version control and is simple to use for anyone. A repository was created that contains all the contents of the webpage, and GitHub desktop was used to push and pull commits as required when changes were made to the source code.</p>
            <p> <b>Atom Editor:</b>
              <br>
              The editor used for website design was Atom Editor. Atom is a modern free text editor by GitHub. The software can be integrated wit GitHub to commit changes directly from the Atom interface – making it the ideal choice for editing.

          <p> <b> 1) Select a domain name: </b>
            <br>Key things to consider when selecting the domain name include:
            <ul>
              <li> Buy both the .co.uk and .com versions of your domain name to avoid confusion to users </li>
              <li> Use keywords for your domain name, in this case the name of the product/company makes sense </li>
              <li> Keep domain name short and memorable, avoid use of numbers and characters where possible </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p> <b> 2) Check the domain name is available: </b>
            <ul>
              <li> Check the domain name is not trademarked – this can be done on the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/search-for-trademark'><b>Government Website</b></a>. It may be worth cross checking across multiple domains to avoid legal trouble. </li>
              <li> Check your domain name has not been taken. Nominet is the official registry of UK domain names and runs a service called <a href='https://www.nominet.uk/whois/'><b>WhoIs</b></a> to check domain names. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p> <b> 3) Register the domain name using a registrar </b>
            <ul>
              <li> Nominet keeps a list of <a href='https://registrars.nominet.uk/uk-namespace/registrar-agreement/list-of-registrars/'><b>official registrars</b></a>. Anyone in the list can be used, and the process of registering varies by registrar.</li>
              <li> Some registrars are accredited – it is recommended to use accredited registrars like <a href='https://uk.godaddy.com/domains/domain-name-search'><b>GoDaddy</b></a>, <a href='https://www.webwiz.net/domain-names/)'><b> WebWiz</b></a>, <a href='https://uk.godaddy.com/domains/domain-name-search'><b> Google Domains</b></a> etc.</li>
              <li> Follow through the process of the registrar and purchase your required domain. Several top-level domains (org, co.uk, com, biz, net etc.) may be available, select as many as required.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p> <b> 4) Purchase the rights to the domain name</b>
            <ul>
              <li> Select how long to keep the rights to the domain name</li>
              <li> Pay a fee to the registrar to make the registration</li>
              <li> Once the transaction is complete, you own the domain name</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p> <b> 5) Link the domain to your website</b>
            <ul>
              <li> Specify the IP address where users go to when using your domain. The process to do this varies depending on your registrar and host server (i.e <a href='https://pages.github.com/'><b>GitHub Pages</b></a>)</li>
              <li> GitHub Pages has an option to set a custom domain under settings of the repository – input your register domain name in the Custom Domain field. This adds a CNAME file to source files</li>
              <li> Configure your Domain Name System (DNS) by creating a CNAME record. This process varies depending on your registrar, but once this is done your domain should be properly configured</li>
            </ul>

          <p>There are too many factors that make a good website to list, but the most important factors are highlighted below:</p>

          <p><b>User Interface Design:</b>
            <br>User interface is how the user interacts with the website. The best websites have user interface at the heart of their design process. There are several key elements to UI Design. Consistency of pages, pleasing aesthetics and intuitive operation are some of the features of a good user interface. Additional features include efficiency of navigation</p>
            <p><b>User Experience Design:</b>
              <br>User Experience Design, while largely like User Interface Design, has key differences. Firstly, UX focuses on optimising a user’s experience of the website, whereas UI focuses on how a user interacts with the website. As such elements of UX that make a great website include minimalism – in design and in content. Keeping layouts uncluttered is key to improving user experience. Additionally, users want to be able to find the information they want without navigating/reading through piles of unnecessary information. Other elements include speed of content loading, frequency of pop up ads and variable colour schemes/text sizes.</p>
              <p><b>Responsive Design:</b>
                <br>With phones, tablets and laptops all become commonplace, the best websites are ones that respond to the different screen sizes. Responsive design means designing the website to ensure that users can access the website in an appealing and intuitive way on all screen sizes. Bootstrap templates are all created with responsiveness in mind – utilising features such as fluid grids and flexible layouts. It can be argued that responsive design is a part of UI Design, while this may be true it is important enough to get its own mention.</P>

                <p>Accessibility in web design terms means that websites are designed so that individuals regardless of any impairment/handicap can still utilise the facilities. Accessibility is an extremely important consideration in User Experience, as user should have equal opportunity to access the information at hand.</p>
                A few examples of accessibility considerations include:
                <ol>
                  <li>Options for increasing/decreasing font sizes to assist in readability</li>
                  <li>Including alt text in images to ensure the gist of images can still be appreciated if they don’t load</li>
                  <li>Options to alter colour schemes to assist with impairment due to colour blindness</li>
                  <li>Navigation with just the keyboard in the event of a mouse not being used</li>
                </ol>

                <p>In order to increase the impact of the website several marketing techniques could be employed. First and foremost, search engine optimisation is pivotal. SEO means increasing the likelihood of appearing higher up the returned results list in a search engine. Individuals often ‘just Google’ information they are interested in and showing up within the first two pages greatly improves the popularity of the website. Search engine optimisation is a complex area which involves intricate knowledge of how search engines work. Indexing the website in popular search engines is a good start. Identifying keywords and utilising them in your source files meta data may also assists in SEO, although less effectively nowadays. <a href ='https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo'><b>Moz</b></a> provide good information on SEO.</P>
                  <p> Additionally, the power of social media is incredible for increasing the presence of a website. Setting aside a budget for sponsored promotion on the likes of Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat will greatly increase the visibility of the website and encourage readership.</p>
